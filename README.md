## Description
This is a responsive lighting product catalogue landing page built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The project simulates an e-commerce browsing experience where users can:
- Filter products by lighting category
- Toggle between light mode and dark mode
- See products visually change depending on room lighting theme
- Browse a clean grid layout with responsive design

This project was inspired by a real-world lighting brand website known for its interactive light mode toggle that switches product visuals from “lights off” to “lights on.”
I recreated a simplified version of this concept as a learning exercise. 

All layout, code structure, and implementation were built independently for practice and portfolio purposes.
